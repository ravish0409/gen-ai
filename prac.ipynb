       "'Today’s session by Pranav\\nToday, Pranav talked about his project called \"Speech Sense.\" He started by explaining why he built the project. He found it difficult to take notes during meetings and figure out the overall sentiment of the discussions. So, he wanted to create something that could automatically summarize the key points from a meeting and understand its sentiment.\\nPranav looked at platforms that offered similar services, but most of them were paid. So he decided he want to develop his own tool. His idea was to create an application that not only summarized meeting recordings but also let users ask specific questions about the meeting. To do this, he used advanced models like GPT and Whisper (a text-to-speech model).\\nFor the first version of his project, he used Streamlit to build the user interface and GPT-3.5 for processing language. However, he faced a few challenges. One issue was with the database, as he needed it to update user interactions in real-time. Streamlit also had a problem where the whole program would restart whenever a user interacted with the interface. To fix this, he used tabs, so only the section that the user was interacting with would reload.\\nPranav said this was just a basic version of his project, so he started working on a better one. He chose Firebase to store data because Streamlit had too many limitations at that time. But another problem came up: for people to use his application, his computer had to be on all the time since it was hosting the app. He realized he needed to deploy the application somewhere else.\\nHe decided to use AWS for this, but then found out that the AWS server could only be accessed from his office network. To fix this, he whitelisted certain IP addresses so he could access the app from anywhere, not just the office.\\nIn the end, Pranav’s journey with \"Speech Sense\" taught him a lot. He faced challenges with the user interface, databases, and deployment, but he kept improving the project step by step.\\n\\n'"
